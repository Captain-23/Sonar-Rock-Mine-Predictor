# Sonar-rock-vs-mine-predictor
A machine learning project that predicts whether an object detected by sonar is a rock or a mine (metal cylinder) based on sonar signal data.

This project uses the Sonar Dataset from UCI Machine Learning Repository, applying Logistic Regression for binary classification. The model analyzes 60 sonar frequency readings to determine the nature of the object.

Although this is just a prototype and has only 4 inputs so the prediction will be slightly different.
Contributions are accepted.
